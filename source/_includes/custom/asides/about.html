<h2>about me</h2>
<p>Iâ€™m a writer and fountain pen fanatic, modeler and programmer, Irish flute and banjo player, cyclist, swimmer, and hiker, cider maker, a digger of all things tech, and all around friendly guy. In the Columbia River Gorge in a town called Hood River I spend most of my life trying to keep my twins alive.</p>
