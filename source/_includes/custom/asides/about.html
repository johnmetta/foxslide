<h2>about me</h2>
<p>I’m a writer and fountain pen fanatic, modeler and programmer, Irish flute and banjo player, cyclist, swimmer, and hiker, cider maker, and a digger of all things tech. In the Columbia River Gorge, in a town called Hood River, I spend most of my life trying to keep my twins alive.</p>
